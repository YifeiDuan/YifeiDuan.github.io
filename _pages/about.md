I am a master's student at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), pursuing dual degrees at [IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/about-us/) and [EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). My research interests include AI for sustainability and AI for science. 

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Elsa Olivetti](https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/elsa-a-olivetti/) for my research, and to receive guidance from [Dr. Jie Chen](https://jiechenjiechen.github.io/) from [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/). My previous and ongoing projects cover the development of AI methods including NLP, explainable AI, GNN, and generative models for application scenarios related to materials informatics and decarbonization of energy and manufacturing systems.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Tsinghua University, China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
